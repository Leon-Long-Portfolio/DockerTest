# Docker Excercise
In this GitHub repository, I developed a Python application for matrix multiplication, encapsulated in a Docker container for easy deployment and execution across different environments. The project includes the matrix_multi.py script, which implements the algorithm for multiplying two matrices, and a suite of tests in test_matrix_multi.py to ensure the correctness of the multiplication functionality. To facilitate development and deployment, we created a Dockerfile that outlines the process for building a Docker image, containing all necessary dependencies, including Python itself and additional packages like memory_profiler and pytest.
